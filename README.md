## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are used to specify the position in the string where the match must occur.

^: Matches the start of the string.
$: Matches the end of the string.
Example:

/^#/
This matches the start of the string if it begins with a "#".


### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present for a match to occur.

?: Matches the preceding element zero or one time.
{n}: Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding element.
{m,n}: Matches at least m and at most n occurrences of the preceding element.


### OR Operator
The OR operator allows for alternative matches.

|: Matches either the pattern on its left or the pattern on its right.
Example:


([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})
This matches either six hexadecimal characters or three hexadecimal characters.

### Character Classes
Character classes match any one of a set of characters.

[a-f0-9]: Matches any hexadecimal digit (0-9, a-f).

Example:
[a-f0-9]{3}

This matches three characters that are either a hexadecimal digit (0-9) or a letter (a-f).


### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () are used for grouping and capturing parts of the regex.

(): Groups multiple tokens together.
(?:): Non-capturing group.

Example:
(?:[a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})

This non-capturing group matches either six or three hexadecimal characters.
